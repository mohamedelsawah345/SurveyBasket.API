# Survey Management System

## Overview
The Survey Management System is a comprehensive platform that allows users to create, manage, and participate in surveys. It features secure user authentication, customizable surveys, and scalable performance optimizations to ensure smooth operations. The system is built with clean architecture, making it modular and easy to maintain.

## Key Features

- **Survey Lifecycle Management**:
  - Full survey management from creation to result display.
  - Ability to create polls, manage questions, collect answers, and show results.
  
- **User Account Features**:
  - Secure registration, login, password reset, and account confirmation.
  - Profile updates for users to manage their personal information.

- **User and Role Management**:
  - Add, edit, and delete users.
  - Assign roles to users (e.g., Admin, User).
  - Lock/unlock user accounts based on admin decisions.

- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Integrated background jobs to handle long-running processes.
  - Caching mechanisms to speed up frequently accessed data.
  - Logging and error handling to track system activity and handle issues.
  - Rate limiting to prevent abuse of the system and ensure fair usage.

- **API Management**:
  - API versioning for easy maintenance and future updates.
  - Comprehensive Swagger documentation and OpenAPI integration for seamless developer onboarding.

- **Security and Authentication**:
  - Utilized JWT authentication to securely manage user sessions.
  - Role-based authorization to ensure users can only access data they are permitted to.


## Achievements

- **Simplified Survey Creation and Participation**: Enabled users to easily create and take surveys, improving overall user experience.
